This script will get seat price data from SJ (Swedish train operator), not to search in timetable. 
For timetable search use for example: http://transport.opendata.ch/
Acces to german prices for domestic german routes can be found in: http://code.google.com/p/openbahn-api/wiki/APIDocumentation
To convert prices to EURO http://www.ecb.int/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref-daily.xml is a good place to start.
